A thesis project in marketing analytics can quickly become tough to manage.
To keep your project structured, we urge you to adhere to the project management guidelines
available at [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/workflow). Specifically, pay close attention to the sections on pipelines and project components, directory
management, and automation.

You're not so much into theory? Then follow our [tutorial on building a project pipeline](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/tutorial), applied to text mining. Allow sufficient time to do so - students have reported it took them an entire day. While text mining may not be the thing you will end up doing, following the tutorial will give you a sense of understanding how to efficiently manage a thesis project.
