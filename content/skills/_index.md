Writing an excellent thesis may require you to go the extra mile. By far most students struggle with their technological toolkit, so it makes a lot of sense investing in your toolkit *before* starting with your thesis process. This especially holds for your stats toolkit (e.g., R) - you won't have time to learn it from scratch merely during your thesis (there is already so much else to learn!).
