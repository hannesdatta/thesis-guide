Make sure you're familiar with a set of software programs to meet your needs.
On [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/), you can learn
about how to configure most of these software programs.

#### Statistical software
- by far most students [use R](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/R) for data preparation/cleaning
and model estimation. We have collected a few tips on how to [learn R here](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/learn/r). We definitely recommend to you to get up to speed with [data manipulation using `data.table` in R](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-datatable-in-r) and [joining data with `data.table` in R](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-with-datatable-in-r). Of course, `dplyr` and `tidyverse` are also a great packages to use!
- If your more into data science, [Python](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/python) is probably the way to go!

#### Managing data-intensive research projects
- Managing a data-intensive research project can be quite a challenge. That's why we have created [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com), which features a boot camp that shows you how to manage such projects efficiently. Check out [some of the tutorials right away!](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/tutorials)

#### Code versioning and automated pipelines
- Please [version your code on GitHub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/learn/github), and review the course material of [Data Preparation and Workflow Management](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com). Please sign up for a GitHub account, and tell us your username so we can add you to relevant code repositories.
- To work efficiently on your empirical research project, you will [automate your project pipeline](/pipeline). Get started early on!
- Get inspired by code snippets that we've used in our research projects ([GitHub repositories](https://github.com/hannesdatta?tab=repositories), [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/hannesdatta))

#### Writing
- Most students write their theses in Word, but a growing number of students has started to shift to a locally installed [Latex](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup/latex) distribution, or its (freemium) cloud-based alternative [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). You can start typing directly in one of the [Tilburg-branded templates](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/tilburg).

#### Others
- Does your data sit somewhere in a **database**? Then learn SQL (for structured databases) or NoSQL (for unstructured databases)!
- Do you plan on [collecting some data via web scraping and APIs](https://odcm.hannesdatta.com), then we recommend you to refresh your Python skills and familiarize yourself with [managing your scraping project](https://web-scraping.org).
