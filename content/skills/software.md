Make sure you're familiar with a set of software programs to meet your needs:

#### Statistical software
- by far most students [use R](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup/R) for data preparation/cleaning
and model estimation. We have collected a few tips on how to [learn R here](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/tips/learn_R/).
- If your more into data science, [Python](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup/python) is probably the way to go.

#### Code versioning
- we recommend you to [version/backup your code on GitHub](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/workflow/versioning/)

#### Writing
- Most students write their theses in Word, but a growing number of students
  has started to shift to a locally installed [Latex](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup/latex/) distribution, or its (freemium) cloud-based alternative [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

#### Others

- Database management
  - does your data sit somewhere in a database? Then learning SQL
(for structured databases) or NoSQL (for unstructured databases) is recommended.
- Data collection
  - Should you plan on collecting some data via web scraping and APIs,
  we recommend you to refresh your Python skills.
-

On [Tilburg Science Hub](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup), you can learn
about how to configure the various software programs.
