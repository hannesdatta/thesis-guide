Make sure you're familiar with a set of software programs to meet your needs.
On [Tilburg Science Hub](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup), you can learn
about how to configure most of these software programs.


#### Statistical software
- by far most students [use R](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup/R) for data preparation/cleaning
and model estimation. We have collected a few tips on how to [learn R here](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/tips/learn_R/).
- If your more into data science, [Python](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup/python) is probably the way to go.

#### Managing data-intensive research projects
- Managing a data-intensive research project can be quite a challenge. That's why we have created [Tilburg Science Hub](http://tilburgsciencehub.com), which features a boot camp that shows you how to manage such projects efficiently.
- At the core of our thinking lies the use of automated project pipelines - learn how to create one for your project [here](/pipeline).

#### Code versioning
- We recommend you to [version and backup your code on GitHub](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/workflow/versioning/)

#### Writing
- Most students write their theses in Word, but a growing number of students
  has started to shift to a locally installed [Latex](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup/latex/) distribution, or its (freemium) cloud-based alternative [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). You can start typing directly in one of the [Tilburg-branded templates](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/tilburg).

#### Others

- Database management
  - does your data sit somewhere in a database? Then learning SQL
(for structured databases) or NoSQL (for unstructured databases) is recommended.
- Data collection
  - Should you plan on collecting some data via web scraping and APIs,
  we recommend you to refresh your Python skills.
