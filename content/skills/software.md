Make sure you're familiar with a set of software programs to meet your needs:

- Database management
  - does your data sit somewhere in a database? Then learning SQL
(for structured databases) or NoSQL (for unstructured databases) is recommended.
- Data collection
  - Should you plan on collecting some data via web scraping and APIs,
  we recommend you to refresh your Python skills.
- Statistical software
  - by far most students use R for data preparation/cleaning
and model estimation.
  - If your more in data science, Python is probably the way to go.
- Code versioning
  - we recommend you to version/backup your code on GitHub
- Writing
  - Most students write their theses in Word, but a growing number of students
  has started to shift to Latex/Overleaf.

On [Tilburg Science Hub](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup), you can learn
about how to configure the various software programs.
