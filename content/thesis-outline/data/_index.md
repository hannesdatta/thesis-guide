The data section typically consists of the following parts.

1. Description of data collection
    * Describe <ins>how</ins> the data was collected (e.g., web scraping, APIs, a cooperation with the       company)
    * Describe <ins>which</ins> data was collected (“the raw data”)
      * E.g., time frame, number of cross sectional units, type of data
      * As an example, please check how I describe my own data collections in published papers

2. Data preparation and variable operationalization
    * Describe how you move from the raw data set to the final data set. See next sections of this guide for more details.

3. Provide descriptive statistics of the final data set

**A few stellar data sections**:
- Please have a look at Gordon, Brett R.,Avi Goldfarb, and Yang Li. "Does price elasticity vary with
    economic growth? A cross category analysis." *Journal of Marketing Research* 50.1 (2013): 4 23. This is
    a very well written description of how the data was prepared. Take it as an example/motivation of how
    you could write up your data section, too.
