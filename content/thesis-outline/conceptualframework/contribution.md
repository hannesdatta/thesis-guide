**Hypothesis Format**

* If you have a strong theory, you can cleanly predict what happens to
Y if you change X.
* In that case, it makes most sense having formal hypotheses in your
paper.
* For example, see Datta, Foubert and van Heerde (2015, JMR, [<ins>https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0160</ins>]() )

**Expectations**

* If your theory is not strong, or your predictions are frequently going
   in both ways (e.g., both positive and negative), itâ€™s wiser to not write
   out formal hypotheses but rather expectations.
* For a paper having expectations, see Datta, Ailawadi , and Van
  Heerde (2017, <ins>[paper here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1509/jm.15.0340)</ins>). Alternatively, a paper can very well do without any hypotheses or expectations, see [here](https://tiu.nu/spotify).

**Important: choose a format that fits your research**
