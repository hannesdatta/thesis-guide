In this section of your manuscript, you explain why you expect a relationship between your covariates (your Xs) and your dependent variable(s) (Ys).

* Have a theory of why you expect a relationship between your Xs and Y(s)
    * The theory can be based on papers, **but also your own logical reasoning**, as long as it motivates the relationship
    * Also think about alternative arguments (X could have a positive relationship, but also a negative relationship)
    * Write up your argumentation, then, end with your hypothesis, or spell out your expectation explicitly (you can also admit the relationship can go in two ways)
* Typically, just hypothesizing an effect to exist is weak; itâ€™s much stronger if you can predict its direction.

Also, your discussion is enriched with a figure that **visualizes your conceptual framework**
* Draw your conceptual framework (and re-draw it until it's perfect)
