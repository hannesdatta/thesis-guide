**Hypothesis Format**

* If you have a strong theory, you can cleanly predict what happens to
Y if you change X.
* In that case, it makes most sense having formal hypotheses in your
paper.
* For example, see Datta, Foubert and van Heerde (2015, [paper here](https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0160))

**Expectations**

* If your theory is not strong, or your predictions are frequently going
   in both ways (e.g., both positive and negative), itâ€™s wiser to not write
   out formal hypotheses but rather expectations.

* For example papers, see Datta, Ailawadi , and van
  Heerde (2017, [paper here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1509/jm.15.0340) or Datta, van Heerde, Steenkamp, and Dekimpe (2022, [paper here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00222437211058102)). 
  
* Alternatively, a paper can very well do without any hypotheses or expectations, see Datta, Knox, and Bronnenberg (2018, [paper here](https://tiu.nu/spotify)). Curious about how to write such so-called "empirics-first" papers? See Golder et al. (2022, [paper here](https://doi.org/10.1177/00222429221129200)). 

**Important: choose a format that fits your research!**
