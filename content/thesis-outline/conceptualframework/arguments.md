* Have a theory of why you expect a relationship between your Xs and Y(s)
    * theory can be based on papers, **but also your own logical reasoning**, as long as it motivates the relationship
    * also think about alternative arguments (X could have a positive relationship, but also a negative relationship)
    * write up your argumentation, then, end with your hypothesis, or spell out your expectation explicitly (you can also admit the relationship can go in two ways)

* Typically, just hypothesizing an effect to exist is weak; it’s much stronger if you can predict its direction

* Draw a conceptual framework (and re draw until it’s perfect)
