* Have a result table. Typically, this is not the output you get from SPSS or R, but a table you compile yourself.
  * E.g., a table combining <ins>multiple models</ins>    
  * E.g., a table dropping those 100 controls you added but that are not worth discussing
  * E.g., adding fit metrics to the table

* Itâ€™s important to consider the exact situation you are in, and making the table fit your purpose
