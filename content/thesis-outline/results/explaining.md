* Hypothesis tests (do this for each hypothesis) / and or revealing results about your expectation
  * Briefly repeat hypothesis (“In H1, we hypothesized that […]”)
  * Report the result in brackets (e.g., “Indeed, the effect of A on B is statistically significant (beta = xx, *p* = .012)")
  * Explain the result (the “why?”)
      * For a confirmed hypothesis, increase the intuition of your hypothesis (“apparently, as hypothesized, A leads to B **because** [repeat,
      etc.]…”)
      * For an unconfirmed hypothesis, explain why you don’t find the effect (e.g., a conceptual reason (effect doesn’t exist, and yo u h ave an
      **argument why it may not exist), or a measurement issue (e.g., data problems), etc.)**

* Remaining variables
  * Explain the effects of control variables here (“The control variables age and gender have face valid effects. For example, all else equal, age increases the intention to purchase (beta = xx, *p* = .12). Education turns out to be not a significant predictor of intention to purchase (beta = xx, *p* = .63). This may be the case because

__Note:__ While hypothesis tests are usually carried out against a *p* value of .05 (or sometimes .10), you need to report the exact *p* value in the text and tables with, e.g., three digits after the decimal point (e.g., *p* = .049, instead of *p* < .05). If you cannot give an exact *p* value because of rounding (e.g., the true *p* value is .00001, but it would round to *p* = .000), you need to write it down as *p* < .001. The *p* needs to be printed in italic always.
