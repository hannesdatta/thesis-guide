After carefully identifying your contribution, it's helpful to visualize it for your manuscript.

#### The classification matrix

One way in you can visualize your contrbiution is to classify your study along two dimensions. For example, in the figure below, **This study** is the only study that investigates Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for *services*, while accounting for the difference between *free trial and regular customers*.

#### The "checkbox" table

An alternative way to visualize your contribution -- especially when you have more than two distinguishing attributes -- is to list it in a "checkbox" table. For example, below you see that **This paper** is the only one addressing all four marketing mix instruments (promotion, advertising, distribution, product), on two dependent variables (brand sales and elasticity), using an novel method (VPM-SE DLM) in many categories (25).

Obviously, the dimensions for your thesis will be different, so you will have to **adjust column headings**.
