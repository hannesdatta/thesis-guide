title: "Synthesis of the literature"
weight: 3

The objective of your literature review is to provide a *synthesized* answer to the following two questions:
- What do we know about the phenomena/research question?
- What do we not know about the phenomena/research question?

**Wrong Approach ("summary")**

      - Study A finds 1
      - Study B finds 2
      - Study C finds 1
      - Study D finds 1+2
      - Study E finds 3
      - Study F finds 4
      - My study contributes to the literature by doing x, y,
      and z.

**Correct approach ("synthesis")**

      - First stream of literature is concerned with 1.
        - Study A supports 1 (+ argument used in study)
        - Study C adds to it (+ argument used in study),
        providing further evidence for 1.
        - But, they miss out on x (-> contribution!)

      - Second stream of literature is concerned with 2.
        - For example, study B and D find 2, while study D
        even supports 1.
        - But, they miss out on y (-> contribution!)

      - Third stream deals with related phenomena.
        - Study E finds 3 (+ why it’s important to your study)
        - Study F finds 4 (+ why it’s important to your study)
        - But, they miss out on z (-> final contribution!)



To sum up, it is very important to provide a synthesis of the literature, rather than merely listing a couple of studies you have read.
