In this section, you need to explain to the reader why your research question *cannot* be answered satisfactorily by the current literature (if it could, then there would be no point in running your study, right?).

We suggest you to proceed in two steps:
* provide a [literature synthesis](synthesis) on "what do we know" and "what do we not know" about your research question, and
* explain your [contribution](contribution) to the literature ("what specific knowledge do you add to the literature?")
