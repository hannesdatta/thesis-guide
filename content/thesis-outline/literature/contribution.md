**Do you have a contribution?**
- Check our [pitch templates](../../../topic/pitch)

**Looking for inspiration what a potential contribution may be?**

* Test the assumptions
    * ...on which a significant stream of research relies
    * Taking a step back and identify core assumptions

* Probe the external validity
    * ...of what we take to be true
    * Common background factors?

* The next new thing
    * Open new domains of inquiry
    * Make sure that this domain has significant implications if it was better understood

* Work backward in the causal chain
   * Examine a variable, that if understood better,
      has major implications for a vast nest of relationships

* Intervene in an accepted causal chain
    * Taken-for-granted relationships? But really, really? What happens if they disappear?

* Challenging conventional managerial practices/beliefs

* Resolve inconsistent findings
    * Requires taking a step backâ€¦
    * Examine a stream of research in a holistic fashion
    * Focus on subtleties, that may have not so subtle implications
