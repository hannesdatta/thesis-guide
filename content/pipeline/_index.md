A thesis project in marketing analytics can quickly become tough to manage.
To keep your project structured, we urge you to adhere to the project management guidelines
available at [Tilburg Science Hub](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/workflow).

At the minimum, we expect a thesis to consist of
- a [well-defined pipeline](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/workflow/pipeline),
- a proper [directory structure](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/workflow/directories),
- a [fully automated workflow](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/workflow/automation), and
- a proper documentation, including [a readme for any raw data that was collected](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/workflow/documenting-data), and an [overarching documentation for the project](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/workflow/documenting-code).

Our [checklist](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/workflow/checklist/) will help you to keep track of the various requirements when building your pipeline.

Optionally, you can make use of the [versioning and project management features of GitHub](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/workflow/versioning/). If you plan a career in marketing analytics or data science, this is our top recommendation.
