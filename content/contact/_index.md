This companion has been published by [Hannes Datta](https://hannesdatta.com),
though it builds on the shoulders of several of my
former colleagues and advisors, all of which
I have (hopefully in a complete sense) listed in
the [acknowledgements section](acknowledgements) of this page.

Want to know more about me and my research? Please browse my [personal website](https://hannesdatta.com) and [research profile at Tilburg University](https://tiu.nu/datta).
