The content for this website has originally been developed
to guide PhD students in Marketing through the process of writing an academic paper.

Specifically, I am grateful for input from:

* Harald J. van Heerde, and his tutorial on “how to publish” (presentation at ANZMAC
Doctoral Colloquium, 2010)
* Jacqueline van Beuningen (who came up with a PhD Survival Guide, in 2009)
* Thesis skills, developed by Jan Meyer (Tecnologica de Monterrey, Mexico) and Anne
Klesse (Rotterdam School of Management, both 2010), and Johannes Bögershausen (developed in 2012)

From 2013 onwards, the content has been continuously updated to
facilitate the MSc thesis coaching process at the Department
of Marketing at Tilburg University.

In December 2019, this website was launched, and the content was renewed considerably.
