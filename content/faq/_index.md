{{< faq "I thought there was an official guide for writing my Master thesis?" >}}
Yes, you're right. The Department of Marketing at Tilburg University has an official guide for writing a Master thesis, and by all means, you need to consider that one leading.
This website should be used as an addendum to that guide, which provides some guidance with regard to the content and process of writing a thesis under the supervision of [Hannes Datta](https://hannesdatta.com).

{{< faq "Help, there is so much material!" >}}
The material on this site (and especially the links to external material) can be overwhelming at times. Talk to your thesis advisor, who can help you make a good choice of what is important for you right now, and what should be put on hold.

{{< faq "I haven't started my thesis yet - which material is relevant?" >}}
There is a bunch of stuff here that you can already work through, long before you first meet with your advisor. For example, you could check your software configuration, learn R or Python (or both), find and refine a topic (or improve upon a topic that you are about to apply to), and get to know your coach (e.g., by reading some papers, browsing websites, etc.).

{{< faq "I am working at a company, and would love to recruit a student to conduct research - how to proceed?" >}}
We're always thrilled companies find us and value the expertise of students and advisors to work on business-relevant research projects. There are typically two routes you can take to recruit a student for your analysis:

First, you could post the position at the [Tilburg Career Portal](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/career/student-career-services/career-portal?page=home&setlang=EN) and at the [Career Portal of Asset Marketing](https://asset-marketing.nl//career/career-opportunities). They have a great reach among our student population, and you'll surely receive applicants!

Second, you could reach out to [Hannes Datta](mailto:h.datta@tilburguniversity.edu), with a brief description about the business problem, and the data that you would provide for the student to work on. If your problems are aligned well with our [research interests](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/hannes-datta), then maybe we can strike up a partnership, and already provide some thoughts on the research project.
