{{< faq "I thought there was an official guide for writing my Master thesis?" >}}
Yes, you're right. The Department of Marketing at Tilburg University has an official guide for writing a Master thesis, and by all means, you need to consider that one leading.
This website should be used as an addendum to that guide, which provides some guidance with regard to the content and process of writing a thesis under the supervision of [Hannes Datta](https://hannesdatta.com).

{{< faq "Help, there is so much material!" >}}
The material on this site (and especially the links to external material) can be overwhelming at times. Talk to your thesis advisor, who can help you make a good choice of what is important for you right now, and what should be put on hold.
