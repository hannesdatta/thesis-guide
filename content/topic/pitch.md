After seeking inspiration and talking to others about your idea, it's time to prepare a proper pitch. 

**The Elevator pitch**

* Imagine yourself going in the elevator and
meeting a fellow student, who asks you to tell
him/her what your research is about...
* Have only 1-2 sentences, adhering to one of the
    following two structure:</br>

    *While ..., our research shows that...</br>
    Despite ..., we find that...*

The most important thing to remember is that you're pitching your research with an exciting angle - something unexpected, something that runs counter to your audience's intuition. This is embodied by the words *while* or *despite* above. 

**The three questions-pitch**

* First, answer the following three questions about your research.

  * (1) What’s new about it?
    * E.g., new data? new variables? new method?
  * (2) Is it useful (and to whom?)
  * (3) Is it interesting?
    * Simply telling something everyone knows already isn’t interesting (known facts ≠ interesting)
    * Does it get people to say "oh, wow!", or "really? didn't know!", or "Aha!"?
    * Would you get your friends excited about it?!

* Then, try to summarize your answer to these three questions in a convincing and to-the-point pitch.

**Tip:**
Your pitch won’t be perfect at the first time – so practice it over and over again – until you really become enthusiastic about it!
