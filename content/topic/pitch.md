After seeking inspiration and talking to others about your idea, it's time to prepare a proper pitch.


**The three questions-pitch**

* Answer the following three questions about your (proposed) research.

  * (1) What’s new about it?**
    * E.g., new data? new variables? new method?
  * (2) Is it useful (and to whom?)
  * (3) Is it interesting?
    * Simply telling something everyone knows already isn’t interesting (known facts ≠ interesting)
    * Does it get people to say "oh, wow!", or "really? didn't know!", or "Aha!"?
    * Would you get your friends excited about it?!

**The Elevator pitch**

* Imagine yourself going in the elevator and
meeting a fellow student, who asks you to tell
him/her what your MSc research is about…
* Have only 1-2 sentences, adhering to one of the
    following two structure:</br>

    *While ..., our research shows that...</br>
    Despite …, we find that…*


**Tip:**
Your pitch won’t be perfect at the first time – so practice it over and over again – until you really become enthusiastic about it!
