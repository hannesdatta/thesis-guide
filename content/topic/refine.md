Finding a good topic/research question to work on takes time and patience. While you're in the process, take note of the following suggestions:

- start writing ideas down
  - writing is not a linear process, first draft doesn’t have to be perfect!!!
- have a working title
  - and revise it at least 10 times
  - play with words, seek inspiration in the literature
- realize that your ideas will continue to change
  - even after data collection... and that’s good!
  - don't get married to your topic instantly, allow some time so that you can really get to know each other first
- find your focus (narrow down your idea)
- start thinking about processes and issues instead of topics (!)
