Alright... You've probably just managed to put together a thesis proposal (if you are using this for your MSc thesis), or defended your Research Master thesis (if you're using this to guide you through the first stages of writing a paper for your PhD). 

Whatever you're working on, though, chance is that your **core research idea** - the raison d'Ãªtre of this whole project - isn't clear
enough yet. Or, in any case, your advisor may think it isn't clear enough yet.

So how do you make your research idea *better*?
