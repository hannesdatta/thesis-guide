Looking for inspiration what a **potential contribution may be**? Here are a few ways you can convince others about the importance of your research. These ways are extremely important when reviewing your literature (and later on stating how you [contribute to the literature](../../thesis-outline/literature)).

#### Test the assumptions
 * ...on which a significant stream of research relies
 * Taking a step back and identify core assumptions

#### Probe the external validity
 * ...of what we take to be true
 * Common background factors?

#### The next new thing
* Open new domains of inquiry
* Make sure that this domain has significant implications if it was better understood

#### Work backward in the causal chain
* Examine a variable, that if understood better, has major implications for a vast nest of relationships

#### Intervene in an accepted causal chain
* Taken-for-granted relationships? But really, really? What happens if they disappear?

#### Challenging conventional managerial practices/beliefs
* For example, most managers to [A], while they should be doing [B]

#### Resolve inconsistent findings
* Requires taking a step backâ€¦
* Examine a stream of research in a holistic fashion
* Focus on subtleties, that may have not so subtle implications
