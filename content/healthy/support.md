You find it difficult to clear up your mind to focus on your thesis?

Tilburg University has a fantastic team of [student psychologists](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/tutoring/psychologist), who offer individual therapy and workshops to improve your well-being.

Several of my students have worked with our psychologists to tackle problems that kept them from unleashing their potential. Do take into account that it may take a while to get an appointment, so better let them know about potential issues earlier than later!
