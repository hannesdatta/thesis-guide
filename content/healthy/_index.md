Writing your thesis can be quite of a stressful journey. After all, it's one of the biggest projects you may have carried out up to this point (certainly larger than assignments or papers you've worked on during your studies).

On top of that, unexpected problems may arise - either directly relating to your thesis (e.g., your data isn't as good as you've hoped for), or (health) issues that affect you or one of your loved ones.

In general, it's good to signal any of these problems early on to your advisor.

- Together with you, your advisor can come up with alternative routes to narrow down the scope of your thesis to meet your changed situation.
- If you experience study delay, you can talk to the program coordinator for an official extension of your deadline.
- Feel you can't manage the situation and look for professional help? [Please talk to our student psychologists](support).
