# Discussion

* Summary of main findings
    * Summarize in a concise way
    * You can also have a summary table with your results (e.g., hypotheses/expectations confirmed/not
      confirmed, etc.)
    * Some inspiration -> see table on the right
* Theoretical and managerial takeaways
    * What can researchers do with your findings? What can managers do and how do you think will it influence their actions?
* Limitations and future research
    * No research is perfect. Neither is yours.
      Be open about its shortcomings!
