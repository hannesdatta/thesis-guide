* Start writing early on
    * Writing is not a linear process. You typically write and edit several sections of your manuscript at the same time
    * Writing does not start when your research has ended, but **accompanies** your research process - right from the start

* Let your writing *inform* your thinking/doing

    * Consider you've done something, **but you struggle to write it up well.**  Sometimes the fix lies in merely rewriting, but most of the time, you could also just consider changing your doing in a way that it's easier to explain.
    * For example, you may have operationalized a variable in a certain way, but realize - after drafting the section - that another operationalization makes way more sense (and is easier to explain, and still valid). Just dare to change the operationalization then!

* Let your writing make choices *for you*
    * Many times, you may struggle to make choices (e.g., on your merging, cleaning, or analysis)
    * *Writing* can help you to make a decision on what the most effective strategy is to merge, clean or analyze your data! Just write down a few versions of "what you would be doing", and then pick the one that sounds most logical.
