It's good practice to prepare your tables first (and discuss them with your advisor), even before starting to start writing your manuscript.

In general, tables **need to be formatted yourself**, e.g., in Word, Excel or Latex. Put differently, **do not merely paste the output from your statistical program in the main text** - these tables are often too elaborate, or do not efficiently combine the results of multiple models).

* Seek inspiration from how tables look in [published articles in good journals](../../literature/journals).
* Make use of packages that format or combine output of your statistical analyses (e.g., `stargazer` in R). 
* The same holds for figures; the R package `ggplot2` is recommended, but also R's regular plotting functionality is great.
* For more advanced tables, you can design them from scratch (e.g., in Word or Excel and manually paste numbers), or automate the entire process using tools such as [TableFill](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/learn/tablefill).

#### Make yourself understood
* Tables and figures should be understandable without reading the
  corresponding sections in the manuscript.
    * Use a clear title: easy to understand, and comprehensive (e.g., *summarize* the main point in the title (e.g., "X increases Y"), rather than using generic titles ("Results").
    * Provide comprehensive table notes wherever necessary.
    * Use clear labels, e.g., for variables
* Avoid colors, also in figures. Most readers will print your thesis in greyscale.
* Note that you can also combine tables into larger ones, and thereby save space (e.g., tables with the same explanatory variables but different coefficients).
* Generally speaking, tables and figures need to be understood without reading the main text.
