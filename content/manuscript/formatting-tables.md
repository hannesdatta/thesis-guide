* Tables need to be formatted yourself, e.g., in Word or Excel, or Latex
* You are not allowed to just paste the output from your statistical program in the main
  text (in the Appendix, it’s ok!)
* Tables (and also figures) should be understandable without reading the
  corresponding sections (i.e., use clear titles, and <ins>add notes</ins> wherever necessary)
* Note that you can also combine tables into larger ones, and thereby save space (e.g.,
  tables with the same explanatory variables but different coefficients)
* Avoid colors (also in figures!) - I’ll print your thesis in greyscale most of the time.
