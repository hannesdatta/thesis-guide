Writing is an essential skill to have - not only for writing your thesis, but also for concisely communicating your ideas in a business setting.

On the next few pages, we share a couple of general writing and formatting guidelines.

We also recommend students to explore the resources on improving your writing, offered by the [Scriptorium at Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/studying/writing-information-skills/scriptorium).
