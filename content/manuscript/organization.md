# My first own project in my PhD is a messed up directory...!

![My Project](/assets/myfinaldoc.png){: style="width:500px"}

# That’s why... this is the directory structure you should use

## Main directory of a project
![MainDirectory](/assets/maindir.png)

## Taking a closer look at analysis
![AnalysisDir](/assets/analysisdir.png)

## Taking a closer look at analysis code
![AnalysisCloser](/assets/analysiscloser.png)


!!! note "Keeping things clean and readable"
        * Understand things months/years after you did them
        * Let others understand your code (e.g., comply with Marketing Science ’s
          replication policy; get cited more frequently)



# Option 1: Use version control
1. **Unlimited “undo"**
    * Which means you will delete unnecessary stuff (but you can recover it any time)
2. **Collaboration**
    * Work in parallel (vs. “George has unsaved changes”, better than emailing)
    * Resolve conflicts (vs. “Hannes’s conflicted copy”)
    * Applies even to collaboration with yourself (at home, on campus, etc.)

-> Gain productivity (and I really mean it!!!)

# Option 1: Use version control (GitHub project management)

# Option 2: Use cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive)
* Make regular backups!
    * TilburgU has a free, unlimited Google Drive account for you...
    * Dropbox also works its magic...!
* Even if not using version control, always adhere to the directory structure given to you.
