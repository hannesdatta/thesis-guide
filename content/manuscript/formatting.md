Please format your document correctly as early as possible (i.e., already when handing your thesis for intermediate feedback).

* Page settings and font
    * A4, <ins>1.5 spaced</ins>
    * Times New Roman, 12pt.
    * Tables in 8pt or 10pt. Footnotes in 10pt. No exception. 
    * No fancy title pages. Always include your student number (SNR).
    * Page limit: 35 pages.
* Use page numbers (bottom right)
    * same font as your text, 10pt
    * page numbers start with 1 on the first page after your title page (the title page doesnâ€™t have any    page number)
* Take time to [proofread your thesis](../selfassess), and use tools such as [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) (note though Grammarly does not perform sanity checks on whether what you say makes sense!)

**Tired of using the default settings of Microsoft Word? Then use one of our templates.**

* Two-column format, Microsoft Word ([Download](/downloads/thesis_template.docx))
