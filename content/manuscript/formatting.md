* Format of your thesis
    * A4, <ins>1.5 spaced</ins>
    * Times New Roman, 12pt.
    * Tables in 8pt or 10pt. Footnotes in 10pt. No exception. No fancy title pages.
    * Page limit: 35 pages.
* Use page numbers (bottom right)
    * same font as your text, 10pt
    * page numbers start with 1 on the first page after your title page (the title page doesnâ€™t have any    page number)
* Adhere to the English way of formatting numbers
    * Decimal points , not commas (e.g., the average is 10.52, and not 10,52)
    * Separation of groups of digits (e.g., there are 1,531 users in the data set, and not 1531; similarly, there are 1,531,213 song plays, instead of 1531213 song plays)
    * Drop leading zeros (e.g., .15 instead of 0.15)
* Take time to proof read your thesis (using a tool like Grammarly is recommended, but does not perform sanity checks on whether it actually makes sense what you say!)
