Write actively, and make sure to engage with your readers.

* Write in active voice (as if you’re having a conversation with a good academic friend)
    * **Example 1**
         * Wrong: “The data has been analyzed and the following results found”
         * Correct: “We analyze the data, and find that [...]”
    * **Example 2**
         * Wrong: “three constructs have been combined”
         * Correct: “we combine three constructs”

* Use the collective “we” (or “I”)
    * Don’t be shy! Either use “I” or the collective “we”
    * This will help you to tell a better story, and also avoid writing in passive voice.

* Avoid writing in “constructs”, but give meaning to everything you say
    * Wrong: “The overall click through rate for users in the “promotion” condition is [...]”
    * Correct: “Promotion focused users had higher click through rates than [...]”

* Use the [correct tense](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/the-three-common-tenses-used-in-academic-writing)
    * the default tense in academic writing is the present simple ("In this study, we show that [...]").
    * you can deviate from that rule and use the past tense if some action has been completed in the past ("To collect the data, we used the Spotify Web API [...]")
    * last, the literature review typically is written in the present perfect tense ("Some studies have found a large impact of X on Y").
