Write actively, and make sure to engage with your readers.

* Write in active voice (as if you’re having a conversation with a good academic friend)
    * **Example 1**
         * Wrong: “The data has been analyzed and the following results found”
         * Correct: “We analyze the data, and find that [...]”
    * **Example 2**
         * Wrong: “three constructs have been combined”
         * Correct: “we combine three constructs”

* Use the collective “we” (or “I”)
    * Don’t be shy! Either use “I” or the collective “we”
    * This will help you to tell a better story, and also avoid writing in passive voice.

* Avoid writing in “constructs”, but give meaning to everything you say
    * Wrong: “The overall click-through rate for users in the “promotion” condition is [...]”
    * Correct: “Users who received a promotion had higher click-through rates than [...]”
