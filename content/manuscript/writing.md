#### Engage with your readers by *writing actively*

* Write in active voice (vs. passive voice), helping you to tell a more engaging story.
    * e.g., "We analyze the data, and find that [...]" instead of "The data has been analyzed and the following results found."
    * e.g., "We combine three constructs [...]" instead of "three constructs have been combined"
    * When writing, think about a particular stakeholder you're "writing for" - e.g., a manager or policy maker.

* Use the collective “we” or "I"
    * When writing actively, make use of "we" or "I". 
    * Even do this if you have previously learnt otherwise.

* Avoid writing in “constructs”, but *give meaning* to everything you say
    * e.g., "Promotion-focused users have a higher-click through rate than [...]" instead of "The overall click through rate for users in the “promotion” condition is [...]”

* Use the [correct tense](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/the-three-common-tenses-used-in-academic-writing)
    * the default tense in academic writing is the present simple ("In this study, we show that [...]").
    * you can deviate from that rule and use the past tense if some action has been completed in the past ("To collect the data, we used the Spotify Web API [...]")
    * The literature review typically is written in the present perfect tense ("Some studies have found a large impact of X on Y").

#### Avoid mistakes

* Pay attention to the small details; do not allow issues with the details to get in the way of an otherwise good thesis.
* Ask friends and fellow students for feedback & proof reading! Do so many times!
* Make use of AI-based tools such as [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) right from the start!
* If writing remains an issue for you, please be in touch with the [Scriptorium](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/studying/writing-information-skills/scriptorium) - they can help you greatly!
