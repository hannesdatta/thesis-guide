**Presentation**
- Is the presentation in line with the requirements? (e.g., not too many headings, inappropriate bold face and italics, etc.)
- Is the layout consistent throughout the text?
- Are there no spelling and punctuation errors?
- Have all grammatical errors been resolved?
- Are all numbers formatted correctly, according to US or UK English?
    * Decimal points, not commas (e.g., the average is 10.52, and not 10,52)
    * Separation of groups of digits (e.g., there are 1,531 users in the data set, and not 1531; similarly, there are 1,531,213 song plays, instead of 1531213 song plays)
    * Drop leading zeros (e.g., .15 instead of 0.15)
- Is the thesis confirming to the length requirements?
- Have all figures and tables been formatted properly?
- Are all references correct and up-to-date? 

**Text type**

- Is the text type appropriate for the audience (i.e., non-colloquial?)?
- Is there no mix of different text types?

**Content**
- Does the reader still have questions after reading the text?
- Does the text contradict itself?
- Is all the information presented in the text correct?
