* Imitate a style of writing (e.g., from your [advisor's own papers](https://tiu.nu/datta), or the style of a paper in the field of your research that you like).
* Generally, we prefer a "paper format" (like you find in the journals) over a traditional thesis format communicated in the Master thesis guide by our department.
