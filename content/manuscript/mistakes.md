**Some students seemingly have established a dangerous mindset about the details…**
* “Missing, incomplete or wrong references are okay in a master
* “Punctuation is no big deal"
* “Grammar issues can be addressed"
* “Details in figures and tables are only relevant in the final version of the thesis.”
* “The listed maximum length of a thesis is really only a rough guideline; it is okay if the manuscript is actually longer.”

**Recommendations:**

* Pay attention to the small details; do not allow issues with the details to get in the way of an           otherwise good thesis.
* Ask friends and fellow students for feedback & proof reading! Do so many times!
* If writing remains an issue for you, please be in touch with the Scriptorium - they can help you greatly!
