Data is a **key ingredient for your empirical research project**. In particular, databases or large datasets may scare you off at the beginning.

Try to become the "owner" of your data, whether you have collected it yourself or used secondary datasets. In other words: know your data extremely well, and find mistakes early on in the process (e.g., so that you can check back with your data provider soon after delivery, or correct your survey/experiment).
