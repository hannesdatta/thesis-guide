Writing your thesis can become quite of a stressful journey. For example, you may run into unexpected problems (e.g., data isn't as good as you hoped for, models do not converge, writing turns out to be difficult). We hope the tips below help you to keep your sanity:

* Follow your own pace: do not compare to others
* Don’t think you haven’t done anything - even merely thinking about an issue is good for your progress (and even taking some time off is!)
* Realize that ups and downs are inevitable
  * E.g., questionnaires, data preparation and analysis
* Do things not related to your thesis
* It’s good to be ambitious (I am, too!), but realize that your thesis
  most likely will not change the world
* Talk to other students of mine / form groups
