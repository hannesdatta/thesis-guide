* Follow the guidelines from this website, keep an eye on the [meeting schedule](../meetings)
* Plan enough time to work on your data
    * This involves collecting and getting a feeling for the data...
    * This also holds for data cleaning and building your project pipeline
* Start building your [project pipeline](../../pipeline) early on (!)
* Read some [papers your coach has written](https://www.hannesdatta.com/#featured) to understand the “research style” (e.g., hypotheses vs. no hypotheses, type of econometric models, type of data)
* Probably we will be iterating through this phase for some time before we start with data analysis, etc.
