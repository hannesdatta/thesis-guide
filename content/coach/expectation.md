**Take responsibility and ownership**
  * This is your research project, not mine! Even if you are working on topics related to my own research interest...
  * It is your responsibility to receive the data outlined in your thesis proposal. If I have made commitments to providing data, make sure to follow up on those.
  * If you are relying on other data suppliers, please make a realistic plan about which data you receive, and when. Delays in the process are your responsibility, not mine.
  * You are the captain of this project.
  * If you don’t know the answer to a question on the spot, say that you need time to
  think about it

**Invest in your skills**  
  * If you expect that writing will become an issue, check the offerings of [Tilburg University's Scriptorium](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/studying/scriptorium/writing)
  * Data preparation and analysis can be quite challenging; make sure to invest in the right skills early on!

**Prepare thoroughly for meetings**
  * Have an agenda of things you would like to discuss.
  * eep an eye on the time so that we do not run over time.
  * Be proactive - make suggestions, be creative, challenge the status quo!
  * Not only come up with problems during your meetings, but also try to already have a set of potential solutions
  * Send stuff (as __PDF documents__, not as Word documents) early enough to allow me to prepare. Generally, this is 24 hours before our meeting.

**Work in a team**
  * If you are supervised in a team, please send your material to each other early enough, so that you can (a) study each other’s work, and provide (b) a round of feedback before submitting material to your advisor

**Keep me up-to-date**
  * Provide a small recap of your project regularly
  * If you experience any kind of problem - whether related to the content of your thesis, or related to your [personal wellbeing](../../healthy) - you can talk to me so I can help you find a solution or refer you to experts that can.
