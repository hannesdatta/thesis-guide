<!--Microsoft Teams
We will use Microsoft Teams for online meetings and communication. You will receive an invitation to join the Team after the official start of your supervision period (as of January 2021).
-->
We use Zoom to meet up.

* You are allowed to use Zoom to record our meetings for personal use (e.g., to facilitate taking notes).
* Before meeting online, test your audio and turn on your webcam.
* Please join the meeting a couple of minutes prior to the start of the meeting, so we can start on time.
* Please be prepared to share your screen.
* If you require feedback on code or data, please have your computer ready for us to work on. In practice, this means having [TeamViewer installed](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/teamviewer/).
