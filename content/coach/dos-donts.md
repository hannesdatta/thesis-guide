**The doâ€™s**

* Appointments
    * Do make an appointment before you come see me
    * Do take into account my busy agenda
* Communication
    * Do let me know if I don't reply to you!
    * Do submit things on time and stick to agreements
    * If you write an email, write it short and to the point
    * When meeting online, test your audio, turn on your webcam, and be prepared to share your screen.
* Feedback and support
    * Do accept my feedback, but also give your feedback to me (!)
    * Do take this companion and the suggestions seriously
* Seeking support from others
    * Do seek support from others - friends may go the extra mile to discuss research questions, find spelling mistakes, or help you fix some errors in your `R` code. However, if you do seek support, *you need to tell me about it* so that I can accurately gauge your own performance, which is crucial for a proper planning.
    <!-- For example, if you have a professional copy editor improve the writing of your thesis proposal (without telling me), then I will likely overestimate your writing capabilities, which may lead to an unrealistic planning of your thesis process.-->

**The Dont's**

* Don't plan meetings for many weeks without informing me
* Don't contact me for every tiny question you have, but first try to find a solution yourself or in discussions with your thesis partner (if you have one)
* Don't plagiarize or use help of others without informing me
* Don't send me long emails, but instead make use of quick questions that you send via WhatsApp (+31134668938)
