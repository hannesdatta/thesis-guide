* Be critical and take responsibility
  * This is your research project, not mine! Even if I gave you some data,
    and even if you are working on topics related to my own research interest...
* Prepare thoroughly for meetings
  * Be active and prepared
  * Have an agenda of things you need to discuss
  * Send stuff early enough to allow me to prepare. Generally, this is 24 hours before our meeting.
  * Not only come up with problems during your meetings, but also try to already have a set of potential solutions
  * If you are supervised in a team, please send your material to each other early enough,
    so that you can (a) study each other’s work, and provide (b) a round of feedback
    before submitting material to your advisor
* During our meetings
  * Don’t take criticism personally (I’m just trying to improve your work)
  * If you don’t know the answer to a question on the spot, say that you need time to
  think about it
* Keep me up-to-date
  * Provide a small recap of your project regularly
* If you experience any kind of problem - whether related to the content of your thesis, or related to your personal wellbeing - let me know so that I can help you find a solution
