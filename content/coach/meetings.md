### Supervision in teams
You are supervised in __teams of about 2-4 students__ who work on similar topics - either from a substantive perspective (the "topic"), or from a methodological perspective. You will be notified about your team mates at the start of your supervision process.

### Online meetings
Your supervision takes place in __online meetings__, potentially with other students that work on similar topics.

  * Please make appointments for your meetings by sending calendar invites to your advisor.
  * Please take into account the busy agendas of your advisor(s).
  * When meeting online, test your audio and turn on your webcam. Please be on time (which means to join the meeting a couple of minutes prior to the start of the meeting).
  * Please be prepared to share your screen. If you require feedback on code or data, please have your computer ready for us to work on. In practice, this means having [TeamViewer installed](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup/teamviewer).

### Conducting your research independently
In-between online meetings, you work __independently on your research__, and stay in close touch with other students (e.g., to give feedback on writing or code). Please bundle questions for your next online meeting. If you're stuck - get in touch with your advisor.

* If you do not receive a reply in reasonable time, please remind me about your message.
* Don't contact me for every tiny question you have, but first try to find a solution yourself or in discussions with other students in your thesis team.
* If you write an email, write it short and to the point.

### Use of Zoom
<!--Microsoft Teams
We will use Microsoft Teams for online meetings and communication. You will receive an invitation to join the Team after the official start of your supervision period (as of January 2021).
-->
Students and staff of Tilburg University have access to the campus license of Zoom. When setting up meetings (please send us calendar invites), please include the link to the Zoom call.
