### Support from your advisor

During your supervision period, I will provide you with feedback, when solicited. Please do not take that criticism personally - I am just trying to improve your work.

My feedback typically falls into one of the three categories below. Please evaluate the importance of my comment, and address it in a revision to your work.

When asking for feedback on __code__ or __data__, please either set up a quick call in Teams and be prepared to share your screen (have everything "ready" for me to work on). If you send your question via email or post it on Teams, please __always__ include the data and code to reproduce your error/work on the problem. It is not sufficient to merely provide a screenshot.

### Support from others

I'm not the only person to ask for feedback. In fact, friends or colleagues may go the extra mile to discuss research questions, find spelling mistakes, or help you fix some errors in your `R` code.

If you do seek support from others, *you need to tell me about it* so that I can accurately gauge your own performance, which is crucial for a proper planning.
