### Preparation

Please prepare the following for your first meeting with your advisor.

* (Re)share your thesis proposal
    * Please email/post your research proposal to your coach, even if you haven't updated it after handing it in (PDF format). Do so at least three days before the meeting.
    * If you're supervised in a team, send the research proposal to members of your thesis circle.

* Review the agenda below to be prepared to address data availability 
    * Will you get access to the data? can you prepare summary statistics of the data already?
    * Necessary investments in developing technical skills (have you learnt everything you need to successfully work on your thesis? (e.g., data preparation, Python for k-means clustering, R for fixed-effects models, etc.)

<!--
* Prepare a rough sketch about your [project pipeline](/pipeline)
    * ideally, walk through the [tour at Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/tour)
    * start to [professionally manage your research project](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com/docs/tutorials/version-control/)
    * set up your [project's pipeline](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/start/new-project)
-->

* Make an evaluation of your individual strengths and weaknesses and share those with me! (this way, we can anticipate problems)
    * What's your ambition with this thesis?
    * Where do you want to be in five years from now?
    * What are you really good at?
