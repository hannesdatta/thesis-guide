When first meeting with your coach, please prepare the following:

* (Re)share your thesis proposal
    * Please email your research proposal to your coach, even if you haven't updated it after handing it in (PDF format). Do so at least three days before the meeting.
    * If you're supervised in a team, send the research proposal to your thesis partner, too.

* Make an overview of the data that you have or plan to use
    * e.g ., inform yourself about the dataset, make some descriptive statistics if possible; see also the section on describing your data on this site

* Make an overview about the software stack you're planning to use (e.g., R, Python)
    * ideally, follow our [tutorial on reproducible workflows](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/tutorial) before you start with your thesis

* Know this website, and the various requirements that are already relevant at this stage of your thesis process

* Make an evaluation of your individual strengths and weaknesses and share those with me! (this way, we can anticipate problems)

* We will most likely discuss the contribution of your study, and your data.
    * Study these sections well and be prepared to pitch your research!!!
    * Have a list of potential contributions of your research
    * Have an initial conceptual model
