    * ideally, walk through the [tour at Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/tour)
    * start to [professionally manage your research project](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com/docs/tutorials/version-control/)
    * set up your [project's pipeline](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/start/new-project)
