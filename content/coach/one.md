# Tips for our meetings

## First meeting with supervisor

* Send research proposal to your thesis partner.
    * If you have updated your proposal after you uploaded it, please also send a copy to me at least three days before the meeting.
* Make an <ins>overview of the data</ins> that you have or plan to use
    * e.g ., inform yourself about the dataset, make some descriptive statistics if possible; see “describe the raw data” in this booklet/slide deck
* Make a <ins>joint plan</ins> (including deadlines), envisioned date of your defense, and an evaluation     of your individual strengths and weaknesses to work on the parts of your plan
    * This is typically your first meeting + 4 or 5 months. Check the department guidelines on this. We will fix your latest defense data when we meet.
* We will most likely discuss the contribution of your study, and your data.
    * Study these sections well and <ins>be prepared to pitch your research!!!</ins>
    * Have a list of potential contributions of your research
    * Have an initial conceptual model

**If these things are not part of your research proposal (yet), prepare them, please!**

!!! note ""
      * Ideally, every activity is done by all students: the one having a strength for it, and the ones that are weak at it. The stronger one(s) will capitalize his/her talent by leading fellow student(s) through the activity.
      * Ideally, each student has multiple activities to do: at least one in which he/she is strong, at least one where he/she is weak. That way, glory will alternate with struggle.
      * The stronger student as a <ins>duty</ins> to collaborate with weaker students. For example, the stronger student may take on a monitoring role.

# Next meetings with supervisor

* Follow the guidelines from this booklet/presentation
* Plan enough time to collect, and get a feel for the data!
* This also holds for data clean up, and analysis
* Read my papers to understand the “style” of research I do
* Probably we will be iterating through this phase for some time before we start with
  data analysis, etc.

# Your defense

* Plan your defense about 4 weeks in advance; your thesis advisor will contact your co
  reader to coordinate about the date
* Hand in a copy of your thesis to the mailboxes of your thesis advisor and co reader a
  week before your scheduled defense date, and upload your thesis to MaMa
* During your defense, you will be asked to clarify your thesis by answering questions.
  You will not have to present your work to us (e.g., by means of a PowerPoint
  presentation)
* Please bring your own copy of the thesis; we may refer to it during our meeting and it
  is useful to take a look at the tables/figures/paragraphs
