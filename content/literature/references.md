When going through the literature, we recommend you to add papers you've read and find relevant (along with a couple of notes if you like) to a reference manager.

Some good tools we've come across are:

- [Mendeley](https://mendeley.com)
- [Zotero](https://zotero.org)
- Wikipedia also has a more [comprehensive list of tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software)

Many times, these tools have an interface with your browser (e.g., [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com)), which eases the process of adding papers. Do make sure you check the actual references yourselves, as many times, imported references still have outdated dates or missing journal names (e.g., you're adding an unpublished working paper from 2017, while the paper has actually been published in a more recent version in 2019).
