When going through the literature, we recommend you add papers you've read and find relevant (along with a couple of notes if you like) to a reference manager.

Some good tools we've come across are:

- [Mendeley](https://mendeley.com),
- [Zotero](https://zotero.org), and
- Wikipedia also has a more [comprehensive list of tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software).

Often, these tools have an interface with your browser (e.g., [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com)), which eases the process of adding papers.

**Important:** Check the references yourselves, as automatic imports are often wrong (e.g., faulty dates, missing journal names). For example, students often cite unpublished working papers while the paper has been published in a more recent version.
