When it comes to finding relevant literature for your thesis, you need to keep in mind that your main mission is not just "to find some papers", but to *find out what is known (or not known)* about

- (a) your particular research question, and
- (b) any methods that you could potentially use to answer your research question.

Note that "method" papers (e.g., propensity score matching) do not really have to deal with your particular subject areas (e.g., estimating how the adoption of a digital platform affects media consumption). In a similar way, "substantive" papers from (a) don't really have to deal with your chosen research design/method.

Read next pages where to look for literature, and how to manage your literature in so-called reference managers.
