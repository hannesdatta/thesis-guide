The marketing literature is often classified into first, second, and third-tier journals.

![Journals](/assets/journals.png)

We recommend you to select a **couple of papers from the first tier**, and make them your guiding "superstar" papers - or, in other words, your **"blueprints" for mimicking style and/or method**.

Of course, the marketing literature isn't the only literature you may want to consider. For example, **related literature streams** from economics, information systems, or data science may become relevant as well. However, keep in mind your thesis will become a "marketing thesis", and as such, a clear connection to the marketing literature (ideally from the top tier journals) is strongly recommended.
